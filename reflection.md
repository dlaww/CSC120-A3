From Alex:
Array list allows you to edit the size of the array while a regular array is a fixed size
Codeacademy
w3schools 
array for canned (generic) responses
array for mirrored responses
array for conversation itself
iterator to count rounds of conversation and continue them

From Cindy: 
Helped to explain set up of array and placement of array code in the main function - explained the placement doesn't matter
need user input first
start with simple for loop to make chat bot spit out a response
then worry about random response
and then the for loop for mirror words
and then the transcript

Logan - different code structure/approach; used a for loop to run rounds of conversation, within that used another for loop for sentences with mirror words, within that used if statement to replace mirror words

I have realized I do not like Java. There are a lot more requirements within the language and I think nuances. Like I can't just run one page I have open and test for bugs - Java runs all of the pages within the repository (?). I am also finding difficulty with formatting pseudocode and what code should be run before others. I'm also unsure of when something should belong to a class or method and when it shouldn't. Should I run the code for the actual conversation itself in the main method? And if so, where do I put the code for running the canned responses? And then how do I integrate the code for mirrored responses? I know that I should be using if statements within a for loop, but will it only split the words if there are mirrors. 

I think some of these issues are also because I'm also still struggling with understanding all of the terminology involved and how that applies to their interactions when I'm coding - I know the repository is essentially like a folder containing all these different files and one can import information from another, but I don't understand why Java won't run just one. I know classes are like blueprints and methods are a series of actions pertaining to a class but I don't think I understand yet when to seperate specific actions from belonging to a class. 

I also had an earlier version that ran the initial conversation and returned the static array of canned responses but then I kept editing and that code was returning errors so I tried to find that earlier version and run it but then it ran all the pages I had. I am very sad because I had a very primitive version of this assignment that functioned and now it won't. I know this has to do with committing the changes but I also am not sure on how to retrieve these older versions. 

I have many issues please help.
